# Lecture 1

Layers of stack
    application - programming language
    systems stuff
    hardware    

stuff inside systems
    - task manager
    - registry
    - PATH
    - file system
    - threads
    - service
    - kernel
    - scheduler
    - processes
    - terminal 
    - libraries
    - frameworks
    - runtimes

What is that stuff and how does it work?

Two types of people
    - "I don't care as long as it works" -> systems knowledge/mental model will improve your programs
    - "I want to know it all" -> how can I improve the system
        - performance, security, sustainability, efficiency 

Goal:
    - build your mental model of the system
    - show you mere mortals (like us) can understand systems
    - gain experience building many pieces ourselves

Touching the magic
    program runs on something magic / HW

System call:
    - way to talk to hardware (underlying system)

Process:
    - abstraction for a running program
    
Course logistics:
    - Dr. Godmar Back since 2009
    - 3 sections : Back, Butt, Williams
    - all infra shared
        - website, forum, chat, grouping
