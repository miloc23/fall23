1. why are there so many prog lang?
2. what maeks a lang successful?
3. why study prog langs?

1. why are there are so many programming languages
    - evolution
    - socio-economic factors
    - orientation towards special purpose /hardware
    - diverse ideas about what is pleasant to use

2. What makes a language successful?
    - writability (expressive power)
    - readability (ease of use)
    - ease of implementation
    - reliability
    - open source
    - excellent compilers
    - cost (economics patronage inertia)

3. Why study programming languages?
    - easy to walk down family tree
    - better implementation based on language knowledge
    - simulate userful features in languages that lack them
    - make better use of language technology whenever it appears
    - get prepared to design new languages or extend existing languages

4. what types of programming languages are there?
    - declarative
        - function lisp/scheme, ML, Haskell
        - dataflow val
        - logic prolog, SQL
    - imperative
        - von Neumann c, fortran
        - object oriented smalltalk, eiffel, java
